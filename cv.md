## ABOUT ME

I am not a programmer. But I'd like to be one. That's why I started study at RS School. I found programming very interesting. I graduated medical university, thus I can learn fast a lot of information in a short time. And I've worked as a doctor in different clinics for about 5 years, so I have enough experience in communicating with people. Therefore I can easily become a part of the team. I like studying and always improving my skills.
